# Mi E-commerce

**Mi E-commerce** is an online store based on the integrative project I did in a group at Digital House. The front-end is built entirely with React, and the back-end with Node.js. Since this project is something I hold dear, I wanted to add more functionalities and options and customize it completely to my liking with total freedom.

## Technologies Used: ðŸ’» 
### Frontend ðŸ–Œ : 
- React.
- Context API.
-  Axios.
### Backend âš™ :
- Node.js, Express, Sequelize.
- JWT, Cookie-Parser for user authentication with HTTP-Only tokens.
- Express-validator, Multer, Bcrypt, CORS.
